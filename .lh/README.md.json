If the `a` or `b` props are not passed, set them to `0`.\n\n**Please note:** use named export (not default).\n\nThe `App` should contain the next `Sum` components:\n\n- `a = 2` and `b = 3`;\n- `a = -5` and `b = 5`;\n- just `a = 10`;\n- just `b = 5`;\n- no params at all.\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Install Prettier Extention and use this [VSCode settings](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/tools/vscode/settings.json) to enable format on save.\n- Implement a solution following the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline).\n- Open one more terminal and run tests with `npm test` to ensure your solution is correct.\n- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://.github.io/react_sum/) and add it to the PR description.\n"
