# Sum Component

Create a `Sum` component accepting `a` and `b` props and rendering a paragraph with a text like `Sum of 2 and 1 is 3`. Replace numbers with actual
values. If the `a` or `b` props are not passed, set them to `0`.

**Please note:** use named export (not default).

The `App` should contain the next `Sum` components:

- `a = 2` and `b = 3`;
- `a = -5` and `b = 5`;
- just `a = 10`;
- just `b = 5`;
- no params at all.
