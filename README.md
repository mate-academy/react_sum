# Sum component
Create a `Sum` component accepting props `a` and `b` and rendering
a paragraph with a text like: `Sum of 2 and 1 is 3`. Replace numbers with actual
values. If `a` or `b` are not passed, set them to 0.

**IMPORTANT:** Use named export (not default)

`App` should contains the next `Sum` components:
- `a = 2` and `b = 3`
- `a = 5` and `b = -5`
- just `a = 10`
- just `b = 5`
- no params at all
